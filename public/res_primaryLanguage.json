      "description": "Hello! I’m Brian Kasprzyk, I’m a Full Stack Software Developer in training and will be looking for work in the coming three months. I chose to pursue this because I’m detail oriented and I love to really dig into projects.  The way I learn is by building a mental map to navigate in my head, which turned out to be not unlike computer language, so we have been getting along quite fashionably. I love science. Space and dinosaurs anything they play on PBS Nova. I decided I would best contribute to humankind's scientific understanding by learning how to engineer software to aid us in the exploration and understanding of the universe around. This passion for exploration helps me adapt to any project I take part in, and ensures that I find a way to bring consistent contribution towards the common effort. I have a mixed history and a varied professional skill that brings unique experience to any team.",
